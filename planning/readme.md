# Planning and Control

## Autonomous Vehicle Club

I'm adding this project, not because it is particularly well done, but rather becuase it was my first experience in robotics. At Utah State University I participated in the Autonomous Vehicle Club. We had a 1/10 scale RC car retrofitted with an IMU and a lidar. We used this car to participate in the Sparkfun Autonomous Vehicle Competition. I joined the team during my Junior year at USU. In my first year on the team I implemented Google Cartographer to improve our SLAM capability. This is also when I became familiar with Linux and ROS. 

In my second year with the team I helped fix a variety of bugs with the low level velocity controller, helped recruit new team members, and improved the simulation capabilities of the team. In coordination with a Mobile Robotics course taught by Dr. Greg Droge, I created a URDF representation of the vehicle. I then took a simple go-to-goal controller provided by Dr. Droge and implemented a bicycle model vehicle to represent the car. You can see the result of that work in this [repository](https://github.com/eichmeierbr/avc_urdf). This video shows my first attempts into vehicular robotics.
